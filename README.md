# Pixel-Perfect Implementation of TransitFlow WebPage

This repository contains my implementation of the Home Page design provided in Figma. I have followed all the style guides provided to ensure a pixel-perfect implementation.

## Code Structure

I have used React, CSS, and Tailwind CSS to implement the design. The code is structured as follows:

src/
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   └── icons/
├── components/
│   ├── button/
│   ├── text/
│   └── ...
├── pages/
│   ├── app.js
│   └── ...
├── styles/
│   ├── tailwind.css
│   └── style.css
└── index.html

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the page
- `style.css`: The main CSS file that contains the styles for the page
- `tailwind.css`: The Tailwind CSS file that contains utility classes for the page

I have organized the code into sections that correspond to the different sections of the page, making it easy to navigate and modify.

## Difficulty Encountered

During the course of my development, I encountered some design-related difficulties, particularly with the use of absolute positioning. It had been a while since I had worked with complex designs, and I had to refresh my knowledge of absolute positioning.

Additionally, this was my first time using Tailwind CSS for styling complex design pages like this, and it was a whole new experience. However, I found that once I got used to the utility classes and the structure of the framework, it made it much easier and quicker to implement the design.
